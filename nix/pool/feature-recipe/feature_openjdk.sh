# Recipe for Open Java Development Kit (=JDK)

# CHANGE in Java/Oracle Licence model:
#		* It is impossible to automate oraclejdk download now
#		* Now there is OpenJDK and OracleJDK
#		* There is a lot of OpenJDK distributor including Oracle (so OpenJDK crom Oracle is not the same than OracleJDK)

# List of OpenJDK distributor : https://dzone.com/articles/java-and-the-jdks-which-one-to-use

# sample usage :
# openjdk=amazoncorretto ./stella.sh feature install openjdk
